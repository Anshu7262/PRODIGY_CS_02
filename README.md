# PRODIGY_CS_02 – Image Encryption via Pixel Manipulation
This project demonstrates a simple image encryption and decryption technique by manipulating pixel values using XOR operations. The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the image.

Features
- Encrypt any image file by scrambling pixel values.
- Decrypt the image back to its original state using the same key.
- Uses a simple numeric XOR key (0–255) for demonstration purposes.

How to Use
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install the required library:
3. Place the input image in the same folder as `image_encryption.py`.
4. Run the program:
5. Follow the prompts:
- Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
- Enter the input image file name (e.g., `test.jpg`).
- Enter the output image file name (e.g., `output.jpg`).
- Enter a numeric key (0–255).
